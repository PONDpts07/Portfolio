# ðŸ“‚ Portfolio

This repository showcases my **Network Engineering Portfolio**, including both certifications and hands-on projects.  
It is organized into two main folders:

---

###  ðŸ”¹ `Certifications & Training /`
Contains certificates from training and courses I have completed, focused on **networking and system administration**.  
include certifications from:  
- Cisco Networking Academy  
- KLIX KMITL  
- Udemy  

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Projects/`
Contains my **Network engineering lab projects** built using **Proxmox VE** and **EVE-NG**.  
These projects cover **Network design, Device configuration, Security, and VPN Deployments** using vendors such as Cisco, Active Directory Freeradius and Graylog.

Each project folder includes:
- **Network Diagrams** â€“ High-level design and topology overview  
- **Lab Topology Screenshots** â€“ From EVE-NG and Proxmox environments  
- **Configuration Files** â€“ Key device configurations (Cisco, Linux services, etc.)  
- **Screenshots & Logs** â€“ Evidence of functionality (VPN tunnels, routing tables, authentication logs, Graylog logs, ping/traceroute, etc.)  
- **Test Results** â€“ Test case documentation with outcomes  
- **Backups** â€“ VM and device configuration backups for recovery  
- **Documentation** â€“ Summary and explanation of the project  

ðŸ“Œ Currently, the `Projects/` folder contains three projects:  
1. **Hierarchical Network Design with Cisco vIOS**  
2. **Enterprise Network Security (Cisco vIOS + AD + FreeRADIUS + Graylog)**  
3. **IPsec Site-to-Site VPN Deployment with Fortinet**

## âœ¨ Notes
- Large backup files (e.g., Proxmox `.vma.zst`) are stored externally (e.g., Google Drive) with download links provided.  
- This repository is intended as a **portfolio showcase** for my skills and hands-on networking experience.
